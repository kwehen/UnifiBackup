# Unifi Backup Automation

The Unifi API spec seems to be a bit **dense**..so I chose the worst route of them all and automated backups through Selenium. UnifiBackup allows you to backup your Unifi network configuration through selenium and upload backup files to S3 (optional).

## docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
services:
  unifibackup:
    container_name: unifibackup
    image: 'jeffhardyski/unifibackup:0.1'
    environment:
      # AWS_ACCESS_KEY: ""
      # AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ""
      # AWS_REGION: ""
      # TARGET_BUCKET: "" # S3 Bucket Name
      USERNAME: "" # Comment out if you do not need to set username
      PASSWORD: "" 
      UNIFI_IP: "" # Router IP Address
      BACKUP_INTERVAL: "72" # Defaults to 24 Hours
      OUTPUT_DIRECTORY: "/output" # Defaults to "~/Downloads"
    restart: unless-stopped 
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kwehen/UnifiBackup.git
   cd UnifiBackup
   ```

2. **Build and run the Docker container**

   The repository includes a `docker-compose.yml` file and a `Dockerfile`:

   - **Docker Compose file**: Defines a service named `unifibackup` that uses the `jeffhardyski/unifibackup:0.1` image. It sets the environment variables required for the backup script and ensures the container restarts unless stopped.

   Run the Docker container:

   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables need to be set for the script to work:

- `USERNAME`: Username for logging into the Unifi Controller (optional)
- `PASSWORD`: Password for logging into the Unifi Controller
- `UNIFI_IP`: IP address of the Unifi Controller
- `BACKUP_INTERVAL`: Interval in hours between each backup (default: 24 hours)
- `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`: Directory to save the backup files (default: `~/Downloads`)
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS access key (optional, required if uploading to S3)
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS secret access key (optional, required if uploading to S3)
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region (optional, required if uploading to S3)
- `TARGET_BUCKET`: S3 bucket name to upload the backup file (optional)


## Script Explanation

### unifibackup.py

This script performs the following steps:

1. Loads environment variables.
2. Sets up the Selenium WebDriver with Firefox in headless mode.
3. Logs into the Unifi Controller.
4. Initiates a backup and waits for the backup file to download.
5. Moves the backup file to the specified output directory.
6. Uploads the backup file to an S3 bucket (if configured).
7. Repeats the process at the specified interval.
